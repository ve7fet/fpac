fpac (4.0.1-beta)
	* failure of call to ioctl returns a <0 value in fpad.c and fpacconf.c

	* removed CR-LF end of lines in this file using DOS2UNIX utility 

 -- Bernard Pidoux <f6bvp@free.fr>

fpac (4.0.1)
	* Tomi made a mistake in his code by not including a term_handler.
	I suppose he figured grouping it in the
	signal_handler routine would be enough but it isn't. Node may receive
	the signal but it doesn't know quite enough to terminate the session
	thus leaving it open. Adding the term_handler will insure proper closure
	of the node. Newer compilers may accept this now, but I am not sure.
	Considering G4APL's node GB7CIP was hit by this exploit last year I can
	only think it still exists. I discovered this bug quite a while ago but
	didn't understand what was going on until I did a trace via gdb.

fpac (4.00.00)
	* Released as version 4.00.00 due to significant changes. Based on 
	  3.27.19 working code (un-released). Compatibility with versions <3.27.18 
	  is not guaranteed

	  including -0 SSID
	* F6BVP fixed 32/64 bit compatability for libwp and computing of wp record age based on GMT
	* F6BVP white pages records are now stored with GMT time to prevent timezone problems on 
	  large systems spanning many timezones
	* F6BVP added more error reporting to wpedit

	  aborting with an error to allow fpacnode to run in standalone mode
	* Patch from SP2LOB fixes error in fpacnode welcome message
	* F6BVP modified fpacnode to accept NetRom callsigns with SSID=0 or no SSID
	* F6BVP modified monitor to stop if no ax.25 ports are defined, clean up some error 
	  messages, report version and build date, and not do frame dump for CLEAR REQUEST and 
	  CLEAR CONFIRMATION
	* F6BVP fixed a segfault in fpacwpd when verbose debugging is turned on and when 
	  context[client] was empty, added build date and version, also removed wp_send_pdu() 
	  in fpacwpd and wp_flush_pdu() in WaitEvent() to avoid crazy tx loops (race condition)
	* F6BVP modified fpacnode to force callsign when using call to upper case and add 
	  -0 SSID if missing
	* K4GBB added now_date() to wplist, wpserve, and wpmaint

	  connected node routing the requested address. Enter either a 10 digit rose address or a 6 digit
	  rose address (local country DNIC is assumed) or a callsign (it must be present in WP database to
	  obtain rose address to trace).

	* If not present, will copy configuration files from etc into /usr/local/etc/ax25 and
	  if necessary creates /usr/local/etc/ax25 directory. This is to avoid silent FPAC abort
	  when starting it without conf file.
