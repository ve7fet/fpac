	  connected node routing the requested address. Enter either a 10 digit rose address or a 6 digit
	  rose address (local country DNIC is assumed) or a callsign (it must be present in WP database to
	  obtain rose address to trace).

fpac (3.27.7) 
	* make will test if /usr/local/etc/ax25/fpac.conf file exists. If yes will not erase.
	* If not present, will copy configuration files from etc into /usr/local/etc/ax25 and
	  if necessary creates /usr/local/etc/ax25 directory. This is to avoid silent FPAC abort
	  when starting it without conf file.
