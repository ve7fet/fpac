USAGE
        PIng <hostname> [<length>]

DESCRIPTION
        Checks if a host can be reached trough the network by sending
        an ICMP Echo Request packet to the host and waiting for it to
        reply. If a reply is received the round-trip-time (RTT)
        between the local and remote hosts is shown.

        If an optional length is specified the data portion of the
        packet is filled with length number of bytes.

EXAMPLE
