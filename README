PREREQUISITES
=============

You need to have current libax25 installed (see http://f6bvp.org/configuration6_RPi.html).

Ensure ax25-apps and ax25-tools are also installed. Ensure all configuration files 
exist.

Installation paths can be changed to suit local requirements, see ./configure --help or INSTALL for 
details. Ensure you install in the same paths used by libax25, ax25-apps, and ax25-tools.

STARTING FPAC
=============
Before starting fpac some configuration are needed for /etc/ax25/fpac.conf, fpac.nodes, fpac.routes and ax25ipd.conf
Pre configured nodes and ROSE routes are provided than should work and can be used as configuration examples.

To start fpac, use the fpac.sh script
Fpac daemon will run in background.

Then you may run FPAC client fpacnode

List of fpacnode client commands may be obtained issuing question mark from fpacnode and 
detailed help on command usage with H followed by the command name.

TODO
====
	* To be compatible with libax25-0.0.9 and up now
	* Upgrade with last ROSE fonctionalities
	  (UI frames routed like I frames for APRS and IP datagrams and increase MTU )
	* Do automatic cleaning of WP database.
	* Find a solution for automatic and dynamic routing.
	* Support an online and switchable compression algorithm.
	* Flexnet Digipeating or perhaps convert flexnet destinations collected in WP
	* Fix all bugs you can found and report.
	* Add new fonctionnalities you request ;-)

You can post your bug reports or requests in the Rose/Fpac mailing list.
