PREREQUISITES
=============

You need to have current libax25 installed.

Ensure ax25-apps and ax25-tools are also installed. Ensure all configuration files 
exist (use `make installconf' to install defaults).

Installation paths can be changed to suit local requirements, see ./configure --help or INSTALL for 
details. Ensure you install in the same paths used by libax25, ax25-apps, and ax25-tools.

STARTING FPAC
=============
To start fpac, use the fpac.sh script

TODO
====
	* To be compatible with libax25-0.0.9 and up now
	* Upgrade with last ROSE fonctionalities
	  (UI frames routed like I frames for APRS and IP datagrams and increase MTU )
	* Do automatic cleaning of WP database.
	* Find a solution for automatic and dynamic routing.
	* Support an online and switchable compression algorithm.
	* Flexnet Digipeating or perhaps convert flexnet destinations collected in WP
	* Fix all bugs you can found and report.
	* Add new fonctionnalities you request ;-)

You can post your bug reports or requests in the Rose/Fpac mailing list.
